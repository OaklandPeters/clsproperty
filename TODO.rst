- Edge-case: inheritance and properties, when those properties are not over-riden
    - Add unit-tests for this
        - Has this already been done?
    - Probably a problem with overriding just one of the setter/getter of the property class object. @data.settter ... does it refer to a new class or old class?
- typedproperty.py: Create, based on notes in 'Property Typecheck Attributes.py': a version of type-checked properties.
